We run a publishing house since 2001 and for more than 13 years we are making use of these packages to publish our books. Here you will find almost everything you need to design a book. Templates are in other folder at the same git company.

Instructions
============

* "git clone" branch "td-producao-texmf" (only) at ~/texmf/tex or at any folder LaTeX can access it (check it with "kpsepath tex | tr : '\n'")
* of course, check if you have LaTeX installed! If it's not, here is a tip: install everything (debian) with "sudo apt-get install texlive-full". 
* create a link from ~/.fonts to ~/texmf/tex/font folder or check Makefile inside ./font.
